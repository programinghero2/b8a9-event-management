      "A Wedding Day Coordinator is a necessity so that everyone but most importantly you can relax and enjoy the most precious moments you've been working toward. Also known as Month-Of Coordination, this service begins 6 weeks prior to your wedding date and is available to secure your date 4 months in advance. At the 4-month mark (or as soon as you book), we can give you vendor recommendations for anything you've not secured yet. With our check list in-hand, you'll be ready to complete your final tasks. We'll re-group for a Detail Planning Meeting, where we put together your wedding timeline, ceremony logistics and more. In the final month, we fully take over vendor communication and tie up all loose ends. We then conduct your rehearsal and wedding day from start to finish, Emergency Kit in hand.  Contact us here if you haven't reserved your Day-Of Coordinator.  "
